<p><strong>Hi.
  <br>
  <br>
  I'm Robert, and you are here because you want to find out more about the person that produced this website.
  <br>
  <br>
   I love to read and write and by the time someone who wants to give me a design job looks at this, I should have a couple novels out. Right now I have seven dogs and six cats (living with the immediate family for now, just because I can) and I also like playing video games, mostly RPG games, but I'll try anything if it looks fun to play. I also like multiplayer games. At the current moment, I am beginning to learn Javascript and have a solid handle on HTML/CSS, and am currently learning javascript for web development/design.
<br>
<br>
Enjoy looking through my portfolio. Thanks.
<br>
- Robert
