<p><strong>Hi.
  <br>
  <br>
  I'm Robert, also known as Setari, SetariM, Setarii, basically 99% of the web handle "Setari" on the internet. You may have seen me around in places, you may not have. That's okay. You are here because you want to find out more about the person that produced this website.
  <br>
  <br>
   I love to read and write and by the time someone of importance looks at this, I should have a couple novels out. Right now I have seven dogs and six cats (living with the immediate family for now, just because I can) and I also like playing video games, mostly RPG games, but I'll try anything if it looks fun to play. I also like multiplayer games. At the current moment, I am beginning to learn Javascript and have a solid handle on HTML/CSS, and am currently learning javascript for web development/design.
<br>
<br>
Enjoy looking through my portfolio. Thanks.
<br>
- Robert
